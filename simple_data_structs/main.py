fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "coconut"] # list
veggies = ("carrot", "broccoli", "potato") # tuple
roots = {"turnips", "beetroot", True, 1, "parsnips"} # set. Note: set does not print out both 1 and True, seems to consider them the same. Seems to also print whichever comes first in the sequence and removes the other.

print(fruits)
print(veggies)
print(roots)
